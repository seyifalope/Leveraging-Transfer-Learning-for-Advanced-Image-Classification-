In this project, I delve into the field of transfer learning for image classification tasks. Transfer learning a powerful approach that involves reusing a pretrained model's knowledge, particularly the weights for a new related task. This project focuses on unraveling the principles and significance of transfer learning in image classification.

This project will be hinged on the following key points
• Overview of transfer learning and its importance in machine learning
•Selection of the pre-trained model used in the project and its original purpose.
•Fine-tuning steps employed to the pretrained model
•Comparison of results: Transfer learning vs. building a model from scratch.
